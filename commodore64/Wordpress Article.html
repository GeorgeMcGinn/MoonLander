<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The Apollo Moon Lander simulator represents a fascinating journey through computing history, evolving from a modern C implementation to two distinct Commodore 64/128 BASIC programs: a text-based input version and a real-time joystick control version. This project demonstrates not only the timeless appeal of space simulation but also the challenges and rewards of adapting sophisticated numerical simulations to the constraints of 1980s home computing hardware.</p>

<h2>Historical Context and Evolution</h2>

<h3>The Original Vision</h3>

<p>The Apollo Lunar Lander simulator began as a C program designed to recreate the critical moments of Apollo lunar landings. The original concept was inspired by the real challenges faced by Apollo astronauts if the Apollo Guidance Computer (AGC) would fail or require manual override during the final descent phase.</p>

<p>The simulation places the player in the role of an Apollo astronaut whose AGC has failed at 7,500 feet above the lunar surface. With the spacecraft carrying random initial velocities (200-700 ft/s downward, 50-200 ft/s horizontal) from emergency burn errors, the player must manually control the Lunar Module's descent engines to achieve a safe landing.</p>

<h3>Multi-Platform Evolution</h3>

<p>The project's evolution across multiple platforms tells a story of both technological advancement and the enduring appeal of retro computing:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>C Implementation</strong>: The original version leveraged modern computing power to implement sophisticated numerical methods, including 4th-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) integration for highly accurate physics simulation.</li>

<li><strong>QB64 Port</strong>: The program was subsequently ported to QB64, maintaining the advanced numerical methods while providing a more accessible development environment and modern compatibility.</li>

<li><strong>Python Version</strong>: A Python implementation was also developed, taking advantage of that language's mathematical libraries and ease of development.</li>

<li><strong>Commodore 64/128 Text-Based Version</strong>: The first C64 adaptation maintained the turn-based input system from the original C program.</li>

<li><strong>Commodore 64/128 Real-Time Joystick Version</strong>: An implementation featuring true real-time control with joystick input, representing a complete reimagining of the user interface for authentic 1980s gaming experience.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Commodore 64 Implementations</h2>

<h3>Version 1: Text-Based Input System</h3>

<p>The initial C64 adaptation closely followed the original C program's turn-based gameplay, where players input burn duration and thrust values via keyboard. This version served as the foundation for understanding the computational constraints and optimization techniques required for the platform.</p>

<h3>Version 2: Real-Time Joystick Control System</h3>

<p>The real-time version represents a complete paradigm shift, transforming the simulation from a turn-based strategy game into an action-oriented real-time piloting experience.</p>

<h4>Real-Time Features</h4>

<h2>The Commodore 64 Challenge</h2>

<h3>Hardware Constraints</h3>

<p>The Commodore 64, while revolutionary for its time, presented significant computational limitations for a physics simulation:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>CPU</strong>: 1 MHz MOS 6510 processor</li>
<li><strong>RAM</strong>: 64KB total system memory</li>
<li><strong>Floating Point</strong>: Software-based arithmetic through BASIC interpreter</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Dramatically slower than modern systems</li>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: 2-button joystick with 4-direction control</li>
</ul>

<p>These constraints necessitated fundamental changes to the simulation approach while maintaining scientific accuracy and engaging gameplay.</p>

<h3>Algorithmic Adaptations</h3>

<h4>From RK4 to Euler Integration</h4>

<p>The most significant technical adaptation was the replacement of 4th-order Runge-Kutta integration with simplified Euler integration:</p>

<p><strong>Original RK4 Method:</strong></p>

<pre>k1 = f(t, y)
k2 = f(t + h/2, y + h*k1/2)
k3 = f(t + h/2, y + h*k2/2) 
k4 = f(t + h, y + h*k3)
y_new = y + h*(k1 + 2*k2 + 2*k3 + k4)/6</pre>

<p><strong>C64 Euler Method:</strong></p>

<pre>y_new = y + h*f(t, y)</pre>

<p>This change reduced computational complexity from 4 function evaluations per time step to 1, achieving approximately 4× speed improvement while maintaining sufficient accuracy for gameplay.</p>

<h4>Real-Time Display Optimization</h4>

<p>The real-time version implements sophisticated display management:</p>

<p><strong>Cursor Positioning System:</strong></p>

<pre>poke 211,18:poke 214,5:sys 58640:print "          ";
poke 211,18:poke 214,5:sys 58640:print int(ct*10)/10</pre>

<p><strong>Performance Considerations:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Values cleared with spaces before updating to prevent visual artifacts</li>
<li>SYS 58640 calls for precise cursor positioning</li>
<li>Selective updates only for changed values</li>
</ul>

<h4>Mission Control Message Queuing</h4>

<p>Both versions implements a sophisticated message queue system:</p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum 10 pending messages</li>
<li>Automatic message removal after display</li>
<li>Support for overlapping guidance periods</li>
<li>Independent correction calculations for vertical and horizontal axes</li>
</ul>

<h2>Scientific Foundations</h2>

<h3>Lunar Physics</h3>

<p>The simulation implements accurate lunar environment physics:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Lunar Gravity</strong>: 5.33 ft/s² (compared to Earth's 32.174 ft/s²)</li>
<li><strong>Vacuum Environment</strong>: No atmospheric drag or weather effects</li>
<li><strong>Mass-Variable Dynamics</strong>: Spacecraft mass changes as fuel is consumed</li>
</ul>

<h3>Spacecraft Dynamics</h3>

<p>The simulation models the complete Apollo Lunar Module system:</p>

<p><strong>Descent Stage:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Dry Mass: 4,700 lbs</li>
<li>Fuel Capacity: 1,500 lbs</li>
<li>Engine: Variable thrust 0-250 lbs/s vertical, ±10 lbs/s horizontal</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Ascent Stage (for abort scenarios):</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Dry Mass: 4,850 lbs</li>
<li>Fuel Capacity: 5,187 lbs</li>
<li>Abort Capability: Can reach lunar orbit (5,512 ft/s)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rocket Equation Implementation</h3>

<p>The simulation correctly implements Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation for abort scenarios:</p>
<pre>Δv = Ve * ln(m_initial / m_final)</pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ve = Exhaust velocity (10,000 ft/s)</li>
<li>m_initial = Total mass before burn</li>
<li>m_final = Dry mass after fuel depletion</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mission Control Simulation</h2>

<h3>Communication Delay</h3>

<p>One of the simulation's most authentic features is the implementation of realistic communication delays:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Signal Delay</strong>: 1.3 seconds (Earth-Moon signal travel time at speed of light)</li>
<li><strong>Processing Delay</strong>: 4.0 seconds (Ground Control analysis time)</li>
<li><strong>Return Signal</strong>: 1.3 seconds (Moon-Earth signal travel time)</li>
<li><strong>Total Delay</strong>: 6.6 seconds</li>
</ul>

<p>This delay system queues Mission Control corrections and displays them at historically accurate intervals, forcing players to make decisions with delayed information—exactly as real Apollo astronauts experienced.</p>

<h3>Advanced Guidance Algorithm</h3>

<p>Mission Control feedback in the real-time version uses sophisticated trajectory analysis:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Independent Axis Analysis</strong>: Vertical and horizontal corrections calculated separately</li>
<li><strong>Proportional Feedback</strong>: Correction magnitude proportional to velocity error</li>
<li><strong>Smart Messaging</strong>: Only sends corrections when needed, "nominal" when trajectory acceptable</li>
<li><strong>Emergency Protocols</strong>: More frequent guidance during dangerous descent phases</li>
</ol>
